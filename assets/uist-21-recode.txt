  abstract = { Software developers frequently confront a recurring challenge of making code transformations—similar
  but not entirely identical code changes in many places—in their integrated development
  environments. Through formative interviews (n = 7), we found that developers were
  aware of many tools intended to help with code transformations, but often made their
  changes manually because these tools required too much expertise or effort to be able
  to use effectively. To address these needs, we built an extension for Visual Studio
  Code, called reCode. reCode improves the familiar find-and-replace experience by allowing
  the developer to specify a straightforward search term to identify relevant locations,
  and then demonstrate their intended changes by simply typing a change directly in
  the editor. Using programming by example, reCode automatically learns a more general
  code transformation and displays these transformations as before-and-after differences
  inline, with clickable actions to interactively accept, reject, or refine the proposed
  changes. In our usability evaluation (n = 12), developers reported that this mixed-initiative,
  example-driven experience is intuitive, complements their existing workflow, and offers
  a unified approach to conveniently tackle a variety of common yet frustrating scenarios
  for code transformations.},
