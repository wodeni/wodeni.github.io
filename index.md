## Research

I am interested in **human-computer interaction**, **programming languages**, and **visualization**. I am fascinated by how well-designed languages enable people to succinctly express abstract ideas in various domains, and how visual representations help people understand and reason about them. I aspire to **help people understand the abstract world** by designing and building powerful, useable languages and tools.

In the past few years, I have been studying [how people make conceptual diagrams](assets/chi-20-natural-diagramming.pdf) and building [**Penrose**](http://penrose.ink), a language-based platform for math diagramming.

## Personal

<audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

My name is ÂÄ™Ê≤ÉÂæ∑ (<a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> n√≠ w√≤ d√©</a>)
in Chinese. **"Nimo"** has been my alias since my [street dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping) days. My first name, often written as "Wode", looks like a single word in English and people often pronounce it that way. If you find it hard to pronounce (<a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> n√≠ w√≤ d√©</a>), try **"Nimo"**.

If I'm not working, I play billiards. I am a member of the CMU Pool Team and play in [ACUI tournaments](https://www.acui.org/billiards/), [BCA 8-ball league](https://www.playcsipool.com/bcapl-home.html) and [USAPL 9-ball league](https://www.playcsipool.com/usapl-home.html).

I also enjoy playing [Yo-yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo). Here are 4 different ways to form a [Green Triangle](http://yoyo.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Triangle):
